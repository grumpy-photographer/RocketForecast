# RocketForecast
Let's predict rocket launches!

The goal of this project is to predict rocket launches based on weather conditions surrounding the launch. 

Currently utilizing free resources including [api.weather.gov](api.weather.gov) and [thespacedevs.com](thespacedevs.com) to collect weather for upcoming launches in the United States. 

My next objective is to add some machine learning to this to analyze past launches and compare them to upcoming launches to determine the chances of a launch vs a scrub.

Stay tuned!
